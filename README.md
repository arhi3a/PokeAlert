Tuesday January 24h 2017 PokeAlert received a Cease and Desist letter from The Pokemon Company International.

This Cease and Desist Letter included the request to remove The Pokemon Company International, Inc copyrighted images which I have now complied with but unfortunately this was not enough for me to continue maintaining PokeAlert.

So...I regret to inform you that I will have to shutdown PokeAlert today.

A big thank you to everyone for having chosen PokeAlert for your Pokemon quest endeavour, hope you guys enjoyed the app!
